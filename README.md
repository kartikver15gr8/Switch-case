# Switch-case
**A switch statement allows a variable to be tested against several values for equality. Each of these values is called a case. Once a matching case is found, its particular block of code is executed. It is an alternative to the more common if-else statement.**

**In Java, a switch statement is used to transfer control to a particular block of code, based on the value of the variable being tested.**
